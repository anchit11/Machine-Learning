# Machine-Learning

This repository showcases the application of various machine learning algorithms to solve classification and regression problems. The project includes the implementation of popular algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, train models, evaluate performance, and make predictions. The goal is to explore the strengths and limitations of these algorithms on different datasets and improve overall understanding of their usage in real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and results shared in this repository!
